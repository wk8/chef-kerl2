Kerl cookbook
=============

A [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) cookbook to manage Erlang instances with [kerl](https://github.com/kerl/kerl).

# TODO wkpo

# Motivation

The [existing kerl cookbook on the supermarket](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/kerl) hasn't been updated since 2011, and doesn't provide features to manage different Erlang versions.
